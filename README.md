# OOP GAME

This is my first project using OOP paradigm in Javascript.

It's a CLI game created in Node environment.

I had a lot of fun creating the project and learned a lot from it :)


# TOOLS

I used Vanilla Js (OOP concepts) and the inquirer library.

# USAGE

To run the project use:  node index.js
